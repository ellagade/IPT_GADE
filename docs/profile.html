            <div class="back">In this picture, this represents one of the biggest dreams I was able to achieve 
                before taking the step of getting my own motorcycle. It holds a special place in my journey, as it symbolizes the hard work, 
                determination, and perseverance I put in to reach my goals. Achieving this milestone gave me the confidence and 
                motivation to pursue even bigger aspirations, including owning a motorcycle, which was another dream I was working toward. 
                It’s a reminder of how far I’ve come and what I’m capable of accomplishing through dedication and persistence.</div>

            <div class="back">This was during my second year in college, and it marked the first time I ever joined a pageant. It was a 
                completely new and exciting experience for me, stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing the challenge. I gave it my all, 
                and to my surprise and delight, I earned the title of 2nd runner-up! It was such a proud moment, not just for the recognition but 
                also for proving to myself that I could achieve something I had never imagined trying before. This experience taught me the value of 
                confidence, hard work, and believing in my abilities, and it’s a memory I’ll cherish forever.</div>

            <img src="./images/PICTURE4.jpg" alt="PICTURE3">
            <div class="back">In this picture, you can see the first significant investment I made in myself. It holds a special place in my heart 
                because it represents the fruits of my hard work and determination as a working student during my first year in college. 
                Balancing academics and a job was no easy feat, but I pushed through challenges and managed to save up for something meaningful that I could call my own. 
                This achievement is a testament to my perseverance and commitment to building a better future for myself, and it makes me incredibly proud. It’s not just 
                about the item I acquired—it’s about the journey, the sacrifices, and the sense of accomplishment that came with it.</div>
